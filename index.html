        <h4>Introducing the worlds first wearable hydration monitor</h4>
        <p>
            Typically, an average person drinks when they are thirsty and that is enough to stay hydrated. I, on the
            other
            hand,
            don't get thirsty. There are many people like me that exist too and we typically get dehydration headaches
            every so
            often or forget to drink water for a long time. What if there was a wearable that took in some parameters,
            measured hydration levels and told you exactly when to drink
            and the amount? Now there is!
